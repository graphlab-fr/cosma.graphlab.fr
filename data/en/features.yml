    Cosma can accommodate all kinds of records and relationships. You can rapidly build a small hierarchical glossary of terms. Or you can patiently accumulate a vast personal documentation containing various types of notes.
    
    Adapt Cosma to your needs: define graphical features according to record or link type; tweak the graph drawing algorithm; customize the appearance of the cosmoscope in CSS.

    Share a cosmoscope by email, on your personal website, via a third-party service… It is a standalone HTML file: each person who opens it will have access to the same data and tools as you.
    
    Each cosmoscope also contains a JSON representation of your records, their relationships and the bibliographic references cited. This structured data that can be reused in other software, from Gephi to Zotero.
