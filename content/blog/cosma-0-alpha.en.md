The first version of Cosma was developed in late 2020 early 2021. It is a command line application and requires Node.js version 15 or higher. We released Cosma in May 2021 and made some updates until July.

In August 2021, we evolved Cosma and developed a GUI application. The first version was retroactively labeled alpha. It is no longer developed or maintained. All iterations of the alpha are archived on Zenodo. The [documentation of the alpha](https://graphlab-fr.github.io/cosma-cli/) remains online.

The CLI version will return in an upcoming update.
