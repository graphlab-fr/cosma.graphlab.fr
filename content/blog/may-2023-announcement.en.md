Cosma evolves through cycles of research and development. Currently, after a period of development that led to version 2.0, we are back in a research cycle.

**We have decided to suspend our work on the GUI.** Its development has been insightful but its maintenance is not sustainable with our current means. It will remain available via GitHub in version 1.1 (stable) and 2.0 (beta). We do not plan to provide any support or updates for it.

**Our focus in the short term is on improving the CLI.** We are working on making the CLI more accessible by simplifying the user experience and providing better documentation, including some examples, as well as a full beginners' guide to using the command line and working with plain text. You can get a glimpse of these new resources here: <https://cosma.arthurperret.fr>

**Our long-term goal is to create a web version.** We are working on a proof-of-concept server version of Cosma, which we intend to use to secure partners and funding. This is not intended as a replacement for the CLI but for the GUI as the more widely accessible version of Cosma.
