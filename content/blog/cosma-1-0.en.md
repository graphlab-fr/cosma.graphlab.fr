After developing a command-line interface (CLI) prototype, we have released Cosma as a stand-alone application with a graphical user interface (GUI), available on macOS and Windows in version 1.0.

The user documentation has been updated. The developer documentation will be updated and published in an upcoming update. A list of known bugs is updated periodically on the [Issues](https://github.com/graphlab-fr/cosma/issues) page of the GitHub repository.
