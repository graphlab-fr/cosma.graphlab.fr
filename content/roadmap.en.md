Cosma evolves through cycles of research and development. Currently, after a period of development that led to version 2.0, we are back in a research cycle.

We have decided to suspend our work on the GUI. Its development has been instructive but its maintenance is not sustainable with our current means. It will remain available in version 1.1 (stable) and 2.0 (beta) but we currently do not plan to provide any support or updates for it. Our focus now is on the CLI, as well integrating Cosma with third-party environments via APIs. This website will be updated soon to reflect these changes.

## Planned projects

1. Improve the way the graph is displayed
2. Add new features (greater integration of bibliographic data; new display modes for the cosmoscope)
3. Develop an API and prototype a server version
