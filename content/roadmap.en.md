## Current work in progress

We are working on Cosma 2.0, [currently available in beta](https://cosma.graphlab.fr/en/docs/v2/user-manual/). It brings the following new features:

- GUI version available on Linux (Debian).
- Management of several projects, each with its own data source and configuration.
- Recursive data directory reading (= Cosma now reads subdirectories).
- Features inspired by the [Otletosphere](https://hyperotlet.huma-num.fr/otletosphere/): use CSV files rather than Markdown files as the data source; assign several types to a record; use thumbnail images in the records and in the graph.
- Chronological mode (= filtering the graph based on time metadata).
- Improved keywords (= filtering the graph based on keywords).
- Selective cosmoscope generation (= excluding records from generated cosmoscope according to different criteria).

## Planned work

- Improve the user experience regarding updates for the GUI version.
- Improve the graph view (especially making the graph display less dependent on the screen size).
- Improve Views.
- Add batch record creation to the GUI version.

## Ideas we are considering

- Option to treat bibliographic references as nodes in the graph.
- Alternative display mode for the cosmoscope, centered on the record rather than the graph, and an adaptive layout to facilitate consultation on small screens.
